# How to Contribute

We are still in the process of preparing the ATS 2.0 codebase for open-sourcing,
and we do not yet have a process for accepting external contributions. This may
change in the future. Please contact us if you have a reason for a pull request.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.
